Automatic responses to postings and emails totally erode the value of communication in these channels. Why would you want to open X or your inbox if you know half of the messages are auto generated? Fast forward 20 years, autoresponders keep mailing eachother, their owners are long dead. This thing and it s siblings will generate an incredible amount of junk.</p><p><span class='author'>@mateosan</span>: ðŸ˜±</p><p><span class='author'>@WzFootballbola</span>: $25/month now</p><p><span class='author'>@twitty-bz2wu</span>: Saw a comment from the developer with hundreds of question, so i think he might go back to prompt his ai to answer to all of these questions. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…</p><p><span class='author'>@MarkRodriguez-l4m</span>: microsoft should hire this developer</p><p><span class='author'>@parthasarathyvenkatadri</span>: Make  a wordle bot that plays wordle and beats humans</p><p><span class='author'>@CMDRScotty</span>: Is this available for Android phones?</p><p><span class='author'>@williamsrdan</span>: Can it fix html code?
